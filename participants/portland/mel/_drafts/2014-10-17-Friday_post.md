Feedback.  I've got feedback.  Starting from week1.   Figuring that this pilot project would have the most feedback for future projects.  How many of us should assist in N.O.?   Selection proecess for the next group of applicants.  And about 12 others on my feedback list.
Okay we had a survey.  But there is still room for more feedback.  It was a good survey so will probably collect the mosst important pieces.
Presentations.  The whole group I sense has nervous anticipation for their piece.  Including the "top students" where projects came easy, but going in front of a live crowd creates some tension.
Mine sucked.  I did better in the past and even on day 3 of Ascend.  On Weds the 10th we had to do an oral presentation to the group on a Git command.  I teamed with Sofie and we had git Diff.  I was better on Day 3 than day 30 as our Diff explanation was very good and had an actual Diff example as I made an error in posting and just made a correction.  Green was the new version and pink/red was the old.

It rained this week, Weds and Friday.  Not bad for the course only 3 days with rain.  

It wasn't until the final day that I got WordPress to carry sound on the live version.  Before you would hit the play button and it would say "reinstalling" or some problem message.
